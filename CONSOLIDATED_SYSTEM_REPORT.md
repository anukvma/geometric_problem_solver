          "measure": 60.0,
          "is_parametric": false,
          "angle_type": "acute"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],

  ]
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Parametric Support**: Handles algebraic expressions (e.g., "2x", "y+3")
- **Relationship Detection**: Identifies parallel, perpendicular, equal edges
- **Angle Storage**: Angles stored as properties of vertex points
- **Containment Hierarchy**: Tracks shapes within shapes
- **Truncation Handling**: Progressive token limits (32k → 65k) with retry logic

#### 2. **GeometricGraphBuilder**
Creates isolated graph representations in Neo4j with namespace isolation.

**Graph Isolation Strategy**:
```python
# All node IDs are namespaced to prevent conflicts
namespaced_id = f"{graph_id}_{local_id}"

# Example:
#   graph_id = "problem_001"
#   point_id = "A"
#   → namespaced_id = "problem_001_A"

# This ensures multiple problems don't share nodes
```

#### 2. **Multi-hop Reasoning**

   ↓
Step 2: Apply Pythagorean theorem: CA² = AB² + BC²
   ↓
Step 3: Calculate: CA² = 9 + 16 = 25
   ↓
Step 4: Solve: CA = √25 = 5
   ↓
Final Answer: CA = 5
```

#### 3. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**

```python
# Progressive token limits with retry
max_attempts = 3
token_limits = [16000, 32000, 65000]

for attempt in range(max_attempts):
    result = attempt_solve(
        problem, graph, theorems,
        max_tokens=token_limits[attempt]
    )

    if result and not result.get('error'):
        return result  # Success

    if attempt < max_attempts - 1:
        logger.warning("Retrying with higher token limit...")
```

**Safe Response Handling**:
```python
def _safe_get_response_text(response):
    """Handle different finish_reason codes"""

    if not response.candidates:
        return None, "No candidates"

    finish_reason = response.candidates[0].finish_reason

    if finish_reason == 1:  # STOP (success)
        return response.text, None
    elif finish_reason == 2:  # MAX_TOKENS
        # Extract partial text, signal retry
        return partial_text, "MAX_TOKENS"
    elif finish_reason == 3:  # SAFETY
        return None, "SAFETY - blocked"
    elif finish_reason == 4:  # RECITATION
        return None, "RECITATION - blocked"
```

#### 4. **Dynamic Learning**
Successfully solved problems contribute back to the theorem knowledge base, any new theorem which is used during solution is stored in the TKB:

```python
def _store_new_knowledge(result, graph_structure, graph_id):
    """Store new theorems discovered during solving"""

    new_theorems = result.get('new_theorems_proposed', [])

    for theorem in new_theorems:
        # Create theorem node
        create_theorem(
            name=theorem['name'],
            description=theorem['description'],
            mathematical_form=theorem['mathematical_form'],
            applicable_shapes=theorem['applicable_shapes'],
            source='dynamic_learning',
            source_problem=graph_id
        )

        # Link to applicable shapes
        for shape in theorem['applicable_shapes']:

## 5. Prompts Analysis

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

The system uses **structured prompting** with clear sections:

1. **Context Setting**: Role definition and task framing
2. **Input Data**: Problem, graph, theorems
3. **Task Instructions**: Step-by-step requirements
4. **Output Format**: Strict JSON schema with validation
5. **Constraints**: Special handling (parameters, multiple choice)

### Key Prompt Techniques

#### 1. **JSON Format Enforcement**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL: JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY - NO MARKDOWN, NO CODE BLOCKS
⚠️  DO NOT wrap JSON in ```json or ``` markers
⚠️  ENSURE all strings are properly quoted with double quotes "..."
⚠️  ENSURE all numbers are valid (not NaN, not Infinity)
⚠️  DO NOT use trailing commas in arrays or objects

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
✓ Response starts with { and ends with }
✓ All strings use double quotes "..." not single quotes
✓ No trailing commas before closing } or ]
✓ Boolean values are true or false (lowercase)
✓ Null values are null (lowercase)
```

#### 2. **Parametric Problem Handling**
```
**NOTE: This problem contains PARAMETERS/VARIABLES**
- You MUST use algebraic reasoning and symbolic mathematics
- Set up equations using parametric expressions from the graph
- Solve algebraically (substitution, elimination, factoring)
- Your answer may be in terms of parameters (e.g., "2x + 5")
- Show all algebraic steps clearly
```

#### 3. **Multi-hop Reasoning Guidance**
```
INSTRUCTIONS FOR MULTI-HOP REASONING:
- Start from known values in the knowledge graph
- Identify applicable theorems based on shapes and relationships
- Chain multiple reasoning steps together
- For each step, explain:
  * What theorem/property you're using
  * Why it's applicable
  * What inputs you're using
  * What outputs you derive
- Continue until you find the target value(s)
```

## 6. Graph Examples

### Example 1: Simple Right Triangle

**Problem**: "Find AC."

**Image Graph**:
```
      A 
      |\
    3 | \ 
      |  \
      |___\
      B  4  C
